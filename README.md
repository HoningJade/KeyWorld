1. Getting Started: documentation on how to build and run your project. For now, simply list and provide a link to all 3rd-party tools, libraries, SDKs, APIs your project will rely on directly, that is, you don't need to list libraries that will be installed automatically as dependencies when installing the libraries you rely on directly. List both front-end and back-end dependencies. 
2. Model and Engine (15% of Project Documentation grade): put a copy of your Storymap here.  List all components of your engine architectures and how they tie together. Draw a block diagram showing your data and control flows in the engine. For each block, describe how the functionalities will be implemented. If your app doesn't have its own engine, describe how you will use the OS sub-systems or 3rd-party SDKs to build your app. You can re-use your engine architecture slides from the DRAFT portion of this assignment, but they should be accompanied by descriptive explanation, e.g., the talk to give accompanying each slide. 
3. APIs and Controller (15% of Project Documentation grade): describe how your front-end would communicate with your engine: list and describe your APIs. This is only your initial design, you can change them again later, but you should start thinking about and designing how your front end will communicate with your engine. If you're using existing OS subsystem(s) or 3rd-party SDK(s) to implement your engine, describe how you will interact with these.
4. View UI/UX: leave this section blank for now.  You will populate it with your UI/UX design in a latter assignment. 
5. Team Roster: a list of team members and each member's contribution. You may simply list each member's full name for now, leaving the contribution description to the end of term. Should you want to make your GitHub public at the end of term, what do you want visitors (potential employer) to know about your contribution to this project?
